In all the three plots below we will use predefined datasets available. 3D-SCATTER PLOT Developing a 3D scatter plot using type=“scatter3d”

```{r}
library(plotly)
temperature_is <-rnorm(90, mean=20, sd=5)
pressure_is <-rnorm(90)
dtime <- 1:90
plot_ly(x=temperature_is, y=pressure_is, z=dtime, type="scatter3d", mode="markers", color=temperature_is)
```

3D SURFACE Haere I am going to try and create a 3D surface plot by using the type=“surface”

```{r}
library(plotly)
terrain <- matrix(sort(rnorm(100*100)), nrow = 100, ncol = 100)
plot_ly(z=terrain, type="surface")
```
SCATTER GRAPH here we are creating a normal scatter plot
```{r}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(x=time(airmiles), y=airmiles, type="scatter")
```
